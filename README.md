## How to Play

- **Objective**: The goal of the game is to control the snake to eat the food that randomly appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

- **Controls**:
    - Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to change the direction of the snake.
    - Press `ESC` to exit the game at any time.

- **Scoring**:
    - Each time the snake eats food, your score increases.
    - Try to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with anything.
